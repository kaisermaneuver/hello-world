# hello-world
a repository to press start to play

from the ice age, to the dole age
there is but one concern
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers

as Anthony said to Cleopatra,
when he opened the chest of frail, o I said
some girls are bigger than others
some girls are bigger than others
some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers

send me the pillow
the one that you dream on

send me the pillow, oh
the one that you dream on

and I'll send you mine...
